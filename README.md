This is a repository for "Finding an Equation for Max Stress on a Plate with a Hole."

Relevant scripts found in "abaqus_scripts" are as follows:

  V1.py: a script generated from running macros on ABAQUS

  V2_test_functions_one_file.py: script that puts make_model, output_data, and submit_job all together rather than running in seperate function files

  V3_convergence_study: generates 10 models and 10 .csv files to prove that the seed size used in V4_phase_one.py is adequate

  V4_phase_one: generates test data for a plate with a hole at different radii
